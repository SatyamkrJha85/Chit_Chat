# Chit_Chat_Chat Application
What is this project?
This is a simple real-time chat application built using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

I built it mostly to use as a starting-point for other applications that have a real-time chat portion..

Application features:
Register new users
Login with users that have registered
Create new chatrooms
Join chatrooms
Chat with other users

# Firebase Setup :
Setup Authentication - Email and Google account
Setup Realtime Database
Setup firebase Storage
Firebase messaging service
download the file google-services.json from firebase console and add to project file
Note: Download the google-services.json file after the Firebase services are set up to automatically include the services in the json file.
Note: When updating the google-services.json file then make sure to invalidate the caches as well as doing a clean + rebuild.
